    <h1>Objects moving slow and fast</h1>
    <p>
      The behavior I want to show with this sketch is how objects react in
      uniformity with user input. The input would be mouse movement and as the
      cursor moves faster, the objects move faster too. If the cursor moves
      slowly, then the objects would move slower. If the cursor is stationary,
      the objects would be still. The intended feeling would be one of
      responsiveness and fluidity and satisfaction.
    </p>

    <h1>Different growth rates</h1>
    <p>
      In this sketch the intended behavior is to show uneven outcomes from the
      same input, in the form of one object growing more/faster than another.
      The input would be mouse clicks on each object. With each click over the
      objects, they would grow at different rates. Over time, one object would
      grow larger than the other. The intended feeling is disparity and
      imbalance.
    </p>

    <h1>Constraint and release</h1>
    <p>
      For this idea I'm thinking about having an object trapped within a visible
      constrained space. The object moves with a key press input but would be
      stuck inside the space unless another input of mouse click is given, which
      would drop the constraint. The user then would have a few seconds to move
      the object outside of the constraint boundaries before they automaticaly
      come back up. If the objects fails to make it out of the constraint in
      time, then the sketch resets to the beginning. The intended feelings for
      this sketch are tension and anxiety from trying to get the object out in
      time and maybe relief once it's free. I think this sketch would be
      interesting to develop because it's a bit more complex and interactive
      than the others and it could be a fun little game to play around with.

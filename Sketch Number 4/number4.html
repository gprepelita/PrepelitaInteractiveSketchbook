    <h1>Meander</h1>
    <p>
      The rules governing the behavior of this sketch are the easing technique
      and the dist() function. Easing is used to move an object towards the
      position of the cursor. The dist() function is used to calculate the
      distance between the current and previous mouse positions. A line is drawn
      between each previous and current mouse position, and the weight of the
      line is determined by the distance between them. This creates a visual
      trail that meanders through the canvas. A text label is displayed when the
      line reaches the resting position of the cursor.

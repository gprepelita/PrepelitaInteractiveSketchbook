    <h1>Meander</h1>
    <p>
      The rules governing the behavior of this sketch are the easing technique
      and the dist() function. Easing is used to move an object towards the
      position of the cursor. The dist() function is used to calculate the
      distance between the current and previous mouse positions. A text label is
      displayed when the line reaches the resting position of the cursor. An
      else statement is used to display a different text label while the mouse
      is moving. Adding the background() function after the draw function
      changes the sketch from a meandering line to a moving circle. The
      background() function clears the canvas after each frame, which prevents
      the line from being drawn and instead creates a single circle that follows
      the cursor.

    <h1>Alarm</h1>
    <p>
      This sketch uses if/then statements to make a circle (the alarm) disappear
      and a square move (wake up)once the user clicks the circle a set amount of
      times. Otherwise, if the circle is not clicked enough, the square and
      circle will stay put. The user will know the state changed when the circle
      disappears and the square starts moving.

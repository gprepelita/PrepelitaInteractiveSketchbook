    <h1>Micro Project - Progress #1</h1>
    <h2>Concept Summary</h2>
    <p>
      This sketch involves a shape inside of a constraint that the user must try
      to get out in a certain amount of time. The user can click the mouse to
      start a timer, after which they will be able to use the arrow keys to move
      the shape around. If they can get the shape out of the constraint before
      the timer runs out, a win message will appear. If they fail, the sketch
      will reset.
    </p>

    <h2>Primary variable</h2>
    <p>
      let gameStarted = false<br />
      <br />
      This variable will be used to determine whether the game has started or
      not. It will be set to true when the user clicks the mouse to start the
      timer and will also allow the user to move the shape around using the
      arrow keys.
    </p>
    <h2>Base Build</h2>
    <p>
      State 1: Shape inside of visible constraint. The user can click the mouse
      to start the timer.<br />
      State 2: Once the mouse is clicked, the constraint becomes invisible and
      the user can move the shape around using the arrow keys.
    </p>

    <h2>Structural Growth</h2>
    <p>
      Over the next few weeks I plan on adding a timer and text to the sketch,
      instructing the user on what to do and how much time they have left, as
      well as a win message. The constraint also needs to be developed further.
      The goal is to have an irregular constraint shape, like a simple maze,
      that the user has to navigate through. There will be one exit somewhere
      that will allow the user to move the shape outside of the constraint and
      win. I also need to build in the functionality of resetting the game in
      case the user fails to get out of the constraint in time. Additionally, I
      want to make the movement smoother and work with holding down the arrow
      keys instead of just tapping them.

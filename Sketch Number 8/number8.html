    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>
      This sketch displays a slideshow of images. The movement is controlled by
      the left and right arrow keys. When the last image is reached, the
      slideshow loops back to the first image. I introduced an inequity in the
      inputs, where the right arrow key moves forward by one image, but the left
      arrow key moves backward by two images. While building this sketch, I
      learned that arrays are important for storing and managing multiple items,
      such as images.

    <h1>Images 2</h1>
    <p>
      This sketch displays a slideshow of images. The movement is controlled by
      the left and right arrow keys. When the last image is reached by pressing
      the right arrow key, the slideshow loops back to the first image. I
      introduced an inequity where pressing the left arrow returns the user to
      the first image. While building this sketch, I learned that arrays are
      important for storing and managing multiple items, such as images.
